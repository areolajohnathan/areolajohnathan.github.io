<h4>1. Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details</h4><br>
<a href="https://github.com/areolajohnathan/ITM352_F22_Repo/tree/main/WODs/SmartPhoneProducts2">Link to my SmartPhoneProducts2 here.</a><br>
This WOD required us to use a loop to generate a table of Smart Phone Products. This is as opposed to hard coding each section. Instead, we generated the product display from the data. Doing this makes the code cleaner and gets rid of the repetitive code to display the products.
<h4>2. Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.</h4><br>
This WOD was fairly simple for me. It only took me two tries. Steps 1 & 2 went easy during my first try, but steps 4 & 5 gave me a bit of trouble and that made me go past the Rx time. I was having trouble with the eval() part because instead of ${eval("name" + i)}, I put ${eval("name" + 1)}. I guess the directions confused me a bit. After the first try, I watched the screencast and realized my mistake and was able to get the Rx time during the second try.

<h4>3. Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?</h4><br>
To prepare for the WOD, I did what I normally do with the previous WODs. I watched the related screencasts and read any source provided to help me understand what I was dealing with. I Googled certain terms "eval" to help me further understand it. I also read the directions for the WOD multiple times so I knew what to expect.

<h4>Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.</h4><br>
To be better prepared, I could have looked up more information about eval() and for loops, in addition to the sources provided in the module. I'll be sure to try this for the next WOD. I could've also looked at the screencast for the WOD to get a glimpse of what is expected.
