  <h4>How One Programmer Broke the Internet By Deleting a Tiny Piece of Code</h4>
<p>
First off, I agree with Koçulu for not wanting to associate with npm anymore. He thought that npm was all about being open-sourced so I can understand his frustration when npm decided to side with Kik and allowing them to claim ownership of the name and package kik. Furthermore, I can see why Koçulu wanted to pull all the packages he registered on npm out. 
</p>
<p>
I was truly suprised after reading this article. It's crazy to know how only 11 lines of code can cause so much havoc on the internet. It's interesting to know how these packages on npm depend on each other, so it's only natural that when one developer pulls his package out, that the packages that utilized his package would start to fail. I can also see how important it is to understand that all software is built on top of other software. Packages depend on other packages and so on.
</p>
<p>
What's even more interesting is the fact that this code was so simple, and it only had a single purpose, which was to add characters to the beginning of a string of text. Yet, a lot of developers relied on this package when they could easily write it themselves. I like how all those who were affected by this situation all banded together on Reddit and GitHub to solve the problem. It really brings into perspective how the open-source community is all about helping each other out.
