  <p>Growing up I was surrounded by technology, which is what helped lead me to pursue a degree revolving around computers. I always had a knack for organization, analysis and being detail-oriented as well. I finished my Liberal Arts degree at Honolulu Community College but I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue for a Bachelors degree so I took some time off and worked for about 2 years. I wasn’t happy with my job and my salary so I decided to pursue a higher education and earn more money. I researched majors I may be interested in, and then I stumbled upon MIS. I looked at similar majors like InfoSec, CyberSec, CompSci, CompEng &amp; InfoTech but when I viewed the pathways for each major I found out that most of them required a lot of math, something I am not so good at. So, I fell back on MIS - which can also bring in that paper. Maybe not as much as some of the other majors I was looking at but it’s enough to fulfill my needs. Viewing the summary of the MIS major and researching jobs that students landed after graduating appealed to me, namely the coding and organizational aspect of it all. And here I am!</p>
